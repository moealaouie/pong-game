<h1>Pong Game</h1>

This project is an implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features two paddles controlled by players and a ball that bounces back and forth between the paddles. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to get the ball past your opponent's paddle.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To get started with Pong, follow these simple steps:

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This game was developed with Python 3.x.

<h3>Installation</h3>

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/moealaouie/pong-game.git```


Navigate into the project directory:

```cd pong-game```


Run the game:

```python main.py```

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

- Right paddle: Use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.
- Left paddle: Use the "W" and "S" keys to move the paddle up and down.

The game continues indefinitely, with the score increasing each time an opponent fails to return the ball. The game can be exited at any time by clicking the game window's close button.
